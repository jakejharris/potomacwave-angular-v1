# FedDataCheck Angular Recreation

This project is an Angular recreation of the FedDataCheck website, showcasing my ability to quickly adapt to new technologies and frameworks. As a React developer transitioning to Angular, this project demonstrates my skills in front-end development and my capacity to learn and apply new concepts efficiently.

## Project Overview

This Angular application recreates the main features and design of the FedDataCheck website, including:

- Home page with hero section
- Features overview
- Team member profiles
- FAQ section
- Contact form

The project utilizes Angular's component-based architecture and integrates with TypeScript for improved code quality and maintainability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/jakejharris/potomacwave-angular-v1.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd potomacwave-angular-v1

3. Install the dependencies:
npm install

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Project Structure

The project follows Angular's standard directory structure:

- `src/app/components`: Contains individual components for each section of the website
- `src/app/services`: Includes any services for data management or API integrations
- `src/assets`: Stores static assets like images and icons

## Features Implemented

- Responsive design using Angular's built-in features and CSS
- Interactive elements such as the FAQ accordion and testimonial carousel
- Form handling for the contact section
- Integration of SVG icons and images
